Lab 1 - Agent Models and Path Planning
- In the Unity3d environment, we implement Hybrid A* for planning and use a PD-controller for tracking to execute a path from start to goal in rectangular terrains.
- Two agents capable of autonomously executing the route were developed, one for a unity car model and one for a drone model. 
- The project culminated in a competition on novel terrains, where our agents and agents from other student groups compete to reach the goal as fast as possible.
